# This file is the entry point to configure your own services.
# Files in the packages/ subdirectory configure your dependencies.

# Put parameters here that don't need to change on each machine where the app is deployed
# https://symfony.com/doc/current/best_practices.html#use-parameters-for-application-configuration
# variables that don't change from an environment to another (here or .env not .env.local)
# app.: is to signify that are app variables not symfony ones.
# don't change => parameters
# si chaque dev peut changer cette variable dans sa machine => env
